    activityDescription: `Water is the unsung hero behind your productivity.
  
  When you code or study intensely, your brain cells fire rapidlyâ€”requiring oxygen, nutrients, and hydration to maintain peak performance. Even mild dehydration can reduce focus, memory, and decision-making ability, which is a serious deal-breaker for developers and tech students.
  
  Most people don't realize that dehydration doesn't always feel like thirst. It sneaks in as **mental fog**, **mild headaches**, **fatigue**, and even **bad moods**. Especially when deep into code or gaming, you can easily go hours without drinking water, silently affecting your energy and output.
  
  ðŸ’¡ **Why Water Matters for Coders**:
  â€¢ It regulates body temperature, preventing burnout and fatigue.
  â€¢ It keeps joints lubricated, important if you type a lot.
  â€¢ It prevents eye dryness from screen time.
  â€¢ It flushes out toxins and balances your mood.
  
  Want to function like a high-performance machine? Then treat your brain like hardwareâ€”keep it cool and fluid.
  
  ðŸ§  Studies show a hydrated brain is faster at task-switching and problem-solving. Whether you're debugging a tricky issue or learning a new framework, water plays a silent role in how well you perform.
  
  ðŸ¥¤ **Pro Tip**: Set a physical bottle at your desk and mark levels (e.g., 10am, 1pm, 3pm, etc.). Gamify it with reminders or pair every â€˜Push to GitHubâ€™ with a â€˜Sip to Liveâ€™.`,
    steps: [
      "Step 1 - Fill a 1L or 2L water bottle and keep it within armâ€™s reach.",
      "Step 2 - Use the 45/15 rule: Every 45 min of work, take a 15-second sip break.",
      "Step 3 - Track your intake: Use an app or mark levels on the bottle itself.",
      "Step 4 - Replace 1 coffee/energy drink per day with lemon or fruit-infused water to prevent dehydration.",
      "Step 5 - End your day with a hydration reflection: Did you feel more alert? Any fewer headaches?"
